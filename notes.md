Notes to myself 

Scope methods are class methods.
Because these are quaries concerning the whole table.

where
find
all
order

scope :method_name -> {where(color: 'red' )}

scope :high_rating -> {where(rating: '5' )}
This brings an array and we need to iterate.

In controller we call it Classname.method_name
